## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Filter Combinations**
   ```
   - Class Owner + Is Processed (for Sessions/Images)
   - Confidence Score + Is Identified (for FaceCrops)
   - Has Email + Class (for Students)
   ```

2. **Test Bulk Actions**
   ```
   - Select multiple items → Apply action → Verify success message
   - Check that actions update expected fields
   ```

3. **Test Search**
   ```
   - Search by partial names
   - Search by related object fields
   - Search across multiple fields
   ```

4. **Test Performance**
   ```
   - Check query count in Django Debug Toolbar
   - Verify select_related/prefetch_related working
   - Test pagination with large datasets
   ```

5. **Test Navigation**
   ```
   - Click links to related objects
   - Use date hierarchy navigation
   - Edit via inlines
   ```
