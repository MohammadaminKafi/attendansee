## Tips & Best Practices

### Image Quality
‚úÖ **Do:**
- Use clear, well-lit photos
- Ensure faces are visible and unobstructed
- Use recent photos for better matching
- Take photos from a similar angle

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Upload blurry or dark images
- Use images with faces partially hidden
- Upload duplicate images
- Use photos with extreme angles

### Optimal Session Setup
1. **Before class**: Create the session and add basic info
2. **During class**: Take photos with a phone or camera
3. **After class**: Upload all photos at once
4. **Review**: Check processing status and face counts
5. **Verify**: Review identified students for accuracy

### Batch Operations
- Upload multiple images simultaneously to save time
- The system processes uploads sequentially
- You can delete and re-upload if needed

### Managing Large Sessions
- For classes with many students, take multiple photos
- Different angles capture more faces
- Use the 20-image limit wisely - quality over quantity
- One or two good group photos may be better than many poor individual shots
