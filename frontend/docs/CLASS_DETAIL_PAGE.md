## Navigation

### Breadcrumb Trail
```
Classes > [Class Name]
```
Clicking "Classes" returns to the classes list.

### Accessing the Page
Click on any class card in the Classes page to view its details.

## Components Architecture

### Page Component
- **ClassDetailPage** (`src/pages/ClassDetailPage.tsx`)
  - Main container for the detail view
  - Loads class data and statistics
  - Manages tab state

  - Search functionality
  
- **StudentsTab** (`src/components/tabs/StudentsTab.tsx`)
  - Students card list
  - Student create/edit/delete modals
  - CSV upload modal with results

### UI Components
- **Tabs** (`src/components/ui/Tabs.tsx`)
  - Reusable tab navigation component
  
- **Table** (`src/components/ui/Table.tsx`)
  - Generic table component with column configuration
  
- **Pagination** (`src/components/ui/Pagination.tsx`)
  - Page navigation with ellipsis for many pages
  
- **Breadcrumb** (`src/components/ui/Breadcrumb.tsx`)

- **StatCard** (`src/components/ui/StatCard.tsx`)
  - Statistics display cards with icons

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used

#### Sessions
- `GET /api/attendance/sessions/?class_id={id}` - List sessions for a class
- `GET /api/attendance/sessions/{id}/` - Get session details
- `POST /api/attendance/sessions/` - Create new session
- `PATCH /api/attendance/sessions/{id}/` - Update session
- `DELETE /api/attendance/sessions/{id}/` - Delete session

#### Students
- `GET /api/attendance/students/?class_id={id}` - List students for a class
- `GET /api/attendance/students/{id}/` - Get student details
- `POST /api/attendance/students/` - Create new student
- `PATCH /api/attendance/students/{id}/` - Update student
- `DELETE /api/attendance/students/{id}/` - Delete student
- `POST /api/attendance/classes/{id}/bulk-upload-students/` - Bulk upload via CSV

#### Class Statistics
- `GET /api/attendance/classes/{id}/statistics/` - Get class statistics

### Data Types

#### Session
```typescript
{
  id: number;
  name: string;
  date: string;
  start_time?: string;
  end_time?: string;
  notes?: string;
  is_processed: boolean;
  image_count: number;
  total_faces_count: number;
  class_enrolled: number;
}
```

#### Student
```typescript
{
  id: number;
  first_name: string;
  last_name: string;
  student_id: string;
  email?: string;
  class_enrolled: number;
}
```

## CSV Upload Format

### Expected CSV Structure
```csv
first_name,last_name,student_id,email
John,Doe,2024001,john.doe@example.com
Jane,Smith,2024002,jane.smith@example.com
Bob,Johnson,2024003,
```

### Notes
- **Header Row**: Check the "CSV file has header row" option if your file includes column names
- **Email Optional**: Email column can be empty
- **Duplicates**: Students with existing student IDs are skipped
- **Results**: Upload shows detailed results including created and skipped entries with reasons

## User Experience

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly card layouts
- Responsive grid system
- Touch-optimized interactions

### Visual Feedback
- Loading spinners during data fetch
- Success/error messages
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Status badges for session processing state

### Performance
- Pagination for large datasets (50+ items)
- Efficient search with client-side filtering
- Parallel API requests for initial load

## Error Handling

- Network failures show error messages
- Invalid form data prevents submission
- Delete operations require confirmation
- CSV upload errors display detailed reasons
- 404 handling for non-existent classes

## Future Enhancements

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Navigate to class detail page by clicking a class
- [ ] Verify statistics display correctly
- [ ] Switch between Sessions and Students tabs
- [ ] Create a new session
- [ ] Edit an existing session
- [ ] Delete a session
- [ ] Search sessions by name
- [ ] Navigate through paginated sessions
- [ ] Add a student manually
- [ ] Edit a student
- [ ] Delete a student
- [ ] Upload students via CSV (with header)
- [ ] Upload students via CSV (without header)
- [ ] Verify upload results display
- [ ] Search students by name/ID/email
- [ ] Click breadcrumb to return to classes

### Edge Cases
- Empty sessions list
- Empty students list
- CSV with duplicate student IDs
- CSV with missing fields
- Invalid date/time inputs
- Delete last student/session
- Large datasets (50+ items)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Sessions not loading**
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify class ID in URL is valid
- Ensure backend is running

**CSV upload fails**
- Verify CSV format matches expected structure
- Check file encoding (UTF-8 recommended)
- Ensure no special characters in data

**Pagination not working**
- Clear browser cache
- Check if total items > items per page (10)

**Search not filtering**
- Ensure search query is lowercase-compatible
- Check search implementation in tab components
