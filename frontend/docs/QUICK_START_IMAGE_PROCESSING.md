## Tips & Best Practices

### Image Upload
- Take photos from multiple angles
- Ensure good lighting
- Avoid excessive blur
- Limit to 20 images per session

### Processing
- Process all images at once for efficiency
- Better internet connection = faster processing
- Don't navigate away during processing

### Face Identification
- Start with clear, frontal face images
- Verify student list is complete before identifying
- Use "Edit Info" to correct student details

### Data Management
- Regularly review identified faces
- Remove duplicate or poor quality face crops
- Keep student information up to date

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Processing
- **Check internet connection**
- **Verify image format** (JPG, PNG)
- **Try processing individually** if batch fails
- **Check browser console** for errors

### No Faces Detected
- **Image quality**: Ensure faces are clear and well-lit
- **Face size**: Faces should be reasonably large in frame
- **Angle**: Frontal or near-frontal views work best
- **Try different image**: Some images may not detect faces

### Can't Assign Student
- **Verify student exists** in class roster
- **Check permissions**: Ensure you own the class
- **Refresh page**: Sometimes state gets out of sync
- **Contact admin**: If issues persist

### Processing Takes Too Long
- **Normal for many images**: Large batches take time
- **Sequential processing**: Images process one by one
- **Don't close browser**: Let it complete
- **Split into smaller batches**: Upload fewer images per session

### Face Crop Not Deleting
- **Check permissions**: Ensure you own the class
- **Refresh page**: Try again after refresh
- **Network issues**: Check internet connection
